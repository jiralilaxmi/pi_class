**Session 1: Project Ideas Brainstorming & Development (2 Hours)**

---

## **Part 1: Brainstorming IoT Project Ideas (45 minutes)**

### **1. Importance of IoT Projects for Learning (10 minutes)**
- IoT projects help in understanding real-world applications.
- Hands-on experience with sensors, actuators, and cloud platforms.
- Enhances problem-solving and teamwork skills.

### **2. Choosing the Right IoT Project (20 minutes)**
- Considerations:
  - **Feasibility:** Can it be built with available components?
  - **Impact:** Does it solve a real-world problem?
  - **Complexity:** Is it suitable for the given time frame?
- Example project ideas:
  - **Smart Agriculture:** Soil moisture monitoring system.
  - **Smart Security:** IoT-based door lock system.
  - **Health Monitoring:** Remote patient monitoring system.
  - **Weather Station:** Live environmental monitoring.
  - **Home Automation:** IoT-controlled lights and appliances.

**Hands-on Activity:**
- Students discuss and finalize their project ideas in small groups.
- Each team writes down key components and working mechanisms.

### **3. Planning the IoT Project (15 minutes)**
- **Defining Objectives:** What problem does the project solve?
- **Components List:** Sensors, actuators, Raspberry Pi, cloud services.
- **Architecture Diagram:** Draw a simple system flowchart.
- **Task Allocation:** Assign roles among team members.

## **Part 2: Starting Project Development (45 minutes)**

### **1. Setting Up Raspberry Pi for Project Development (15 minutes)**
- Ensure all components are working.
- Install necessary libraries and dependencies.
- Set up Raspberry Pi OS and connect to the internet.

### **2. Writing Initial Code for Sensor Interfacing (20 minutes)**
- **Example: Reading from a DHT11 Sensor (Temperature & Humidity)**
  ```python
  import Adafruit_DHT
  sensor = Adafruit_DHT.DHT11
  pin = 4
  
  humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read(sensor, pin)
  if humidity is not None and temperature is not None:
      print(f"Temp={temperature}C  Humidity={humidity}%")
  else:
      print("Failed to retrieve data")
  ```
- Students write their own basic scripts to test sensor readings.

**Hands-on Activity:**
- Teams test their primary sensor components and ensure they get data readings.

### **3. Debugging & Initial Testing (10 minutes)**
- Check if the Raspberry Pi recognizes all connected components.
- Ensure correct wiring and pin configuration.
- Fix any syntax errors in the initial code.

## **Wrap-Up & Q&A (10 minutes)**
- **Review:**
  - How to choose a good IoT project.
  - Setting up Raspberry Pi for project development.
  - Writing initial code and debugging issues.
- **Encourage Questions:** Troubleshooting assistance for students.

---

## **Homework/Practice Task**
- Improve the initial sensor script by adding data logging.
- Research how to send sensor data to an IoT cloud platform (e.g., Thingspeak, Firebase).
